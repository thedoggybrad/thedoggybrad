Here is my mod (modification) to this component named "Captcha" by Arsalan Shah (OSSN Core Team Leader). This mod simoly just changes the font to the Infiltrace Font by John Bloor. What I want here is to just simply make the font of the Captcha much harder to read. 
I recommend to add this to a future version of the component but this one is having the version 1.4mod as its version number. Its up to the component's author whether to use this mod or not.

Note: Even me had to look very very careful to enter the proper Captcha code. I do not recommend using this mod if your OSSN site users are having some eye problems.
