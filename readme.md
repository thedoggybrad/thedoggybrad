## A. Edgescape Navigator
Edgescape Navigator is a web browser which is literally just a web browser. It has no bloatware, no mess and no unnecessary features. Just buttons for forward, backward, reload, homepage and about and also the addressbar. It is powered by EdgeWebView2 runtime.<br>

## D. EasyList Mirror (UNOFFICIAL)

## E. VirusTotal Website Security Check
This is the VirusTotal Website Security Check, it is created by TheDoggyBrad Software Lab. It allows you to check the security of a website by typing in the full URL of the website. Then it automatically opens the VirusTotal security page that shows the result of various AV-provider's hypothesis on that website., similar to the behavior of a VirusTotal API. But... this site does not use an API key. Instead it is a reverse-engineering of the URL search function of the VirusTotal website. You may look at its code and use the extension version for your web browser.

## F. NewsOrgOnMastodon
The NewsOrgOnMastodon system of Mastodon accounts aims to deliver news and media organizations' presence to Mastodon (mastodon.social) by syncing their content to Mastodon from their official platforms such as RSS Feeds, thus serving as an unofficial Mastodon relay-bot of that news/media organization.<br>
