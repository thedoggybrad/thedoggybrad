## D. VirusTotal Website Security Check
This is the VirusTotal Website Security Check, it is created by TheDoggyBrad Software Lab. It allows you to check the security of a website by typing in the full URL of the website. Then it automatically opens the VirusTotal security page that shows the result of various AV-provider's hypothesis on that website., similar to the behavior of a VirusTotal API. But... this site does not use an API key. Instead it is a reverse-engineering of the URL search function of the VirusTotal website. You may look at its code and use the extension version for your web browser at https://github.com/thedoggybrad/vt_web_check
